Big Number Theory - Dice Probability Simulator 🎲

This program simulates dice rolls in very large quantities to observe
how random distributions behave as the sample size grows.

Features:
- Simulates from small to huge sample sizes (up to 10^8 safely)
- Measures execution time for each simulation
- Displays probability distribution for each dice face
- Includes small time delays for visual clarity and pacing
